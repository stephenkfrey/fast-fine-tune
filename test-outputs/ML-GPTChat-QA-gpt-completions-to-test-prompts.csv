What are the steps for stochastic gradient descent? ,"

The steps are as follows:

1) Initialize the weights randomly.
2) For each training example, compute the output of the network.
3) Compute the error for the output of the network.
4) Compute the gradient of the error with respect to the weights.
5) Update the weights in order to reduce the error.
6) Go back to step 2.
