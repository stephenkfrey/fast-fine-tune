"a group of warlocks caravaning the desert
","
evolving squirrely laughter from the shrilly whirling winds of the desert

evolving to a life of parasitic symbiosis endemic to the desert

faintly starlight glistening on metal chains littered with old bones

fanciful architecture built from chiseled sandstone

factories pumped steam from their chimneys

fallen temples toppled like sand dunes against the red dunes

false belief that the travel's costs would be offset by fees paid for naming the land after oneself

fantastical legends composed around the cursed land

far more leisurely pace than most places of commerce

fatally poisoned in your sleep amongst the sand dunes by cloaked assassins while you dreamed of black-sailed galleons rocking in stormy seas

feet bound in rags of cloth, shuffling through the sand

ferocious sandstorms scouring the land in varying patterns throughout the year

first the ghostlights came

flame-domed church that survived the burning of the town

flies circled over the fresh corpse

flooded by its own people seeking escape during the war

forerunners of the modern merchant caravan

fortified hillside watchtowers overlooking the desert

fortress becomes a ruin after sand swallows it whole

found outside of time and space in the deep desert between time and space

fruition gains us nothing

funereal call to prayer echoing from the spires of the pyramids

furuous mane of narrow dunes

fuzzy red-purple horizon in all directions

gated community of foreigners here to facilitate trade

gazelle hunt by moonlight

getting ahead of yourself again, the wolf said

glaring light that filtered down through broken glass

glorious kingdom of a thousand years founded upon alchemical mysticism and human servitude

gold wash paid to keep the border open and allow rights of passage

great (some) roads of the empire crisscrossed the desert

grid of new towns and cities established in the desert and along trade routes

group of explorers in a red truck with bright blue accents and decals

gypsy steppes where wagons and horses still flourish

hankering for dissident literature and dark romance novels outlawed by the state

haunt by those who insist on"

"my worst nightmare

""Olive Forever"" became an LGBT cult film. According to Edwards' friend, Robert Polidori, who met him on set, Elizabeth Taylor and Rock Hudson and ""the entire crew did cocaine all night long"" celebration party after the end of the shoot. Polidori also stated that there were some homosexual relationships among the cast and crew including him and the set photographer, and that they shared at least one threesome. According to Polidori, Taylor said privately that she ""felt sorry for Sam being a nelly queen"". A few years later, according to Polidori, Taylor and Hudson broke out laughing about the film at a Los Angeles party when it came on TV and commented, ""Sam thinks he was making Harry Cohn's ""All About Eve"", but all he really made was ""Gigot"".""

A. H. Weiler of ""The New York Times"" called it ""a choiceless though solemnly entertained film ... both amusing and ridiculous, not because its characters can't be taken seriously or because they're phony, but simply because they're preposterous. They do what they do and their handsomeness is their undoing."" ""Variety"" wrote: ""Although we are treated to some vigorous action sequences and narration, the more important element in this costly American International Pictures entry is just plain weirdness. This gives the film a bizarre quality and surreality that differentiates it from the normal youthful sex romps."" Richard L. Coe of ""The Washington Post"" called it ""bizarre [and] episodic."" Janet Maslin, also of ""The New York Times"", called it ""a cobbled-together oddity, a less than melodious blend of hard knocks blaxploitation, brash, pop culture-inflected partying and flip social satire."" Allmovie wrote, """"Olive"" is far from great, but represents an ambitious attempt on Edwards' part to deal with weighty issues that Hollywood seldom, if ever, had touched upon before. It is not surprising that the film has attracted a cult following."" 

Allmovie wrote, """"Olive Forever"" is a movie in which virtually nothing happens (it's just over 90 minutes long), yet this works to its advantage. This quirky, mildly satirical revenge fantasy is supported by top-notch art direction, coloring, costume design and cinematography, which oddly enough contribute more toward conveying the front-of"

an image of loving care

a story of life from afar....

And in my soul I hear a cry, a prayer.

I heard it all these years, but never knew

a love from someone else that was so near.

of my life was he,

the wisest elf there's been

since Christ was not

And now I may say

my days on earth are done:

I go where he is gone,

and weep and mourn alone.
