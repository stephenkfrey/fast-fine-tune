    "# - Based on your file extension, your file is formatted as a CSV file\n",
    "# - Your file contains 56 prompt-completion pairs. In general, we recommend having at least a few hundred examples. We've found that performance tends to linearly increase for every doubling of the number of examples\n",
    "# - Your data does not contain a common separator at the end of your prompts. Having a separator string appended to the end of the prompt makes it clearer to the fine-tuned model where the completion should begin. See https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/preparing-your-dataset for more detail and examples. If you intend to do open-ended generation, then you should leave the prompts empty\n",
    "# - All completions end with suffix ` `\n",
    "#   WARNING: Some of your completions contain the suffix ` ` more than once. We suggest that you review your completions and add a unique ending\n",
    "# - The completion should start with a whitespace character (` `). This tends to produce better results due to the tokenization we use. See https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/preparing-your-dataset for more details\n",
    "\n",
    "# add a space to the end of each prompt\n",
    "# Each prompt should end with a fixed separator to inform the model when the prompt ends and the completion begins. A simple separator which generally works well is \\n\\n###\\n\\n. The separator should not appear elsewhere in any prompt."
