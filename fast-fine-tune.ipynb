    "# - Based on your file extension, your file is formatted as a CSV file\n",
    "# - Your file contains 56 prompt-completion pairs. In general, we recommend having at least a few hundred examples. We've found that performance tends to linearly increase for every doubling of the number of examples\n",
    "# - Your data does not contain a common separator at the end of your prompts. Having a separator string appended to the end of the prompt makes it clearer to the fine-tuned model where the completion should begin. See https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/preparing-your-dataset for more detail and examples. If you intend to do open-ended generation, then you should leave the prompts empty\n",
    "# - All completions end with suffix ` `\n",
    "#   WARNING: Some of your completions contain the suffix ` ` more than once. We suggest that you review your completions and add a unique ending\n",
    "# - The completion should start with a whitespace character (` `). This tends to produce better results due to the tokenization we use. See https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/preparing-your-dataset for more details\n",
    "\n",
    "# add a space to the end of each prompt\n",
    "# Each prompt should end with a fixed separator to inform the model when the prompt ends and the completion begins. A simple separator which generally works well is \\n\\n###\\n\\n. The separator should not appear elsewhere in any prompt."

      " The neural network is a popular technique from machine learning that was first used to solve pattern recognition problems. The technique is based on a simple processing model which emphasizes the importance of processing layers to solve data problems. Machine learning refers to this approach as supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning is a straightforward pan of machine learning where the problem is to predict well-defined values of unobserved response variables or supervised learning tasks or to identify spatial or temporal dependencies in a set of variables or inputs. Deep learning is an advanced form of machine learning which relies on training deep, multi-layered artificial neural networks that learn to represent the hierarchical structure of objects and ideas in data through the building blocks of artificial neurons and synapses. More specifically, it is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to learn representation and performing complex tasks such as image and speech recognition. Synthetic Neural Networks (SNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Deep Learning Models are all different from each other. To get a better understanding of the difference between neural networks in deep learning, one of our experts wrote a blog about their differences for Geometric Intelligence readers. Read about these differences and learn more about the expertise of our research team!\n",
      "\n",
      "What does our term “Deep Learning” mean? – What is Deep Learning Behavior?\n",
      "\n",
      "The term Deep Learning combines several neural network techniques under one name. These include “Classic Neural Networks”, which are relatively shallow. To solve complex problems, the neural network is supplemented by multiple hierarchically deeper connections. This so-called Deep Structure is the base of Deep Learning Algorithms. What is Deep Learning Behavior? Deep Learning is the interaction and collaboration of all the fields of Artificial Intelligence with each other. By combining all of them, researchers and companies are able to achieve amazing achievements in the field of media analysis, language processing, movement prediction, data mining, scene recognition and many other areas. For example, Microsoft recently created a general translation program that translates not just in one language but almost any language. Furthermore, Google has become good at automatic translation since it can translate German and English, Spanish and German, etc. In this case, Deep Learning means that the Robots learn from their environment to complete the task of the user correctly and without / with little direction. The robot learns from interacting with people and its environment what it should and should not do, for example, put your cell phone on the table as you sit down;\n"

      "\"Olive Forever\" became an LGBT cult film. According to Edwards' friend, Robert Polidori, who met him on set, Elizabeth Taylor and Rock Hudson and \"the entire crew did cocaine all night long\" celebration party after the end of the shoot. Polidori also stated that there were some homosexual relationships among the cast and crew including him and the set photographer, and that they shared at least one threesome. According to Polidori, Taylor said privately that she \"felt sorry for Sam being a nelly queen\". A few years later, according to Polidori, Taylor and Hudson broke out laughing about the film at a Los Angeles party when it came on TV and commented, \"Sam thinks he was making Harry Cohn's \"All About Eve\", but all he really made was \"Gigot\".\"\n",

They do what they do and their handsomeness is their undoing.\" \"Variety\" wrote: \"Although we are treated to some vigorous action sequences and narration, the more important element in this costly American International Pictures entry is just plain weirdness. This gives the film a bizarre quality and surreality that differentiates it from the normal youthful sex romps.\" Richard L. Coe of \"The Washington Post\" called it \"bizarre [and] episodic.\" Janet Maslin, also of \"The New York Times\", called it \"a cobbled-together oddity, a less than melodious blend of hard knocks blaxploitation, brash, pop culture-inflected partying and flip social satire.\" Allmovie wrote, \"\"Olive\" is far from great, but represents an ambitious attempt on Edwards' part to deal with weighty issues that Hollywood seldom, if ever, had touched upon before. It is not surprising that the film has attracted a cult following.\" \n",
